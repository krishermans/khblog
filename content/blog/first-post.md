After several attempts, once again I'm going to try to do some writing. This time, I decided to use a more &quot;DevOps-sy&quot; way of doing things:

- a static blogengine ([Hugo](http://gohugo.io/)) transforms all my posts written in markdown
- everything is stored in a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/krishermans/khblog)
- a push to this repo triggers a deploy on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

Best of all: everything is for free!

Happy reading!
